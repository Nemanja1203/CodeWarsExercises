//Your task is to construct a building which will be a pile of n cubes.
//The cube at the bottom will have a volume of n^3, the cube above will have volume of (n-1)^3
//and so on until the top which will have a volume of 1^3.

//You are given the total volume m of the building. Being given m can you find the number n of cubes you will have to build?

//The parameter of the function findNb (find_nb, find-nb, findNb, ...) will be an integer m and you have to return the integer n such as n^3 + (n-1)^3 + ... +1 ^ 3 = m if such a n exists or -1 if there is no such n.

//Examples:
//findNb(1071225)-- > 45

//findNb(91716553919377)-- > -1
