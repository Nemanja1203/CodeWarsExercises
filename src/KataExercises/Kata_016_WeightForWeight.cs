//My friend John and I are members of the "Fat to Fit Club (FFC)".
//John is worried because each month a list with the weights of members is published
//and each month he is the last on the list which means he is the heaviest.

//I am the one who establishes the list so I told him: "Don't worry any more,
//I will modify the order of the list".It was decided to attribute a "weight" to numbers.
//The weight of a number will be from now on the sum of its digits.

//For example 99 will have "weight" 18, 100 will have "weight" 1 so in the list 100 will come before 99.

//Given a string with the weights of FFC members in normal order can you give this string
//ordered by "weights" of these numbers?

//Example:
//"56 65 74 100 99 68 86 180 90" ordered by numbers weights becomes: 

//"100 180 90 56 65 74 68 86 99"
//When two numbers have the same "weight", let us class them as if they were strings(alphabetical ordering)
//and not numbers:

//180 is before 90 since, having the same "weight" (9), it comes before as a string.

//All numbers in the list are positive numbers and the list can be empty.

//Notes
//it may happen that the input string have leading,
//trailing whitespaces and more than a unique whitespace between two consecutive numbers
//For C: The result is freed.
